Note: A local account and a BAND account are required
to identify each individual member, therefore, they are needed
for the user to be able to use the page as intended.

Abysmal Light Fireteams is a web page created using Wix.com

This web page connects to the BAND Open API 
(https://developers.band.us/) to write
posts and comments on behalf of the user.

BAND is an app focused on groups and communities,
similar to Whatsapp or Facebook. Where users can
chat, make posts and comments to interact with other members
of the same group (usually referred to as BANDs).

Abysmal Light is a small community of gamers that revolve around
the game Destiny 2, developed by Bungie.
This group uses BAND as its main form of communication,
that's why this tool was designed to be able to connect with
the BAND API.

Its main function is to create 'fireteams' and to post
on the group's main BAND (Abysmal Light) to let other members
know when a fireteam is created and what 'activity' is 
intended to be completed.
